## Testing

Quality assurance was a continuous part of this project's development lifecycle. Throughout the entire build process, I employed a rigorous testing methodology to ensure the optimal performance and user experience of the FASTLANE platform.

My primary focus during testing involved:

- Responsive Design Validation: Meticulous checks were performed across a spectrum of device sizes and orientations to confirm that all features and layouts adapted seamlessly, providing a consistent and intuitive experience regardless of screen dimensions.
- Feature Verification: Every implemented feature, from navigation elements to interactive forms and content display, was rigorously tested to confirm flawless operation.

I actively utilized browser developer tools (such as Chrome Developer Tools) to resolve any issues promptly as they arose. This proactive approach ensured that all functionalities performed as intended, contributing to a robust and reliable user interface. Any identified discrepancies were addressed to guarantee that all aspects of the website operate perfectly, delivering a smooth and efficient experience.

## BUGS

Many bugs were identified and successfully resolved throughout the development process as they arose.

### Known Bugs

- **iOS/Android Parallax Effect: The background-attachment:** fixed property in the .elevate section does not produce the intended parallax effect on iOS and some Android browsers, causing the background image to scroll with the content. This is a common mobile browser limitation.
- **"Why FASTLANE?" Section Card Stretching (Tablets):** On tablet viewports, the cards within the "Why FASTLANE?" section can stretch excessively, impacting the visual balance of the layout.

### Solved Bugs

- **Horizontal Scroll on Mobile:**<br>
Issue: The hero video section caused a horizontal scrollbar on mobile devices, indicating content overflowing to the right.<br>
Resolution: Applied margin-right: 0; to the containing Bootstrap .row and padding-right: 0; to the .video-repsonvise (likely intended as .video-responsive) wrapper. This explicitly removed any extra spacing that caused the overflow.
- **iOS Video Autoplay:**
Issue: Videos might not autoplay inline on iOS devices by default.
Resolution: Added the playsinline attribute to the video tag to enable inline autoplay on iOS.
- **CSS Header Color Specificity:** <br>
Issue: A previous CSS bug caused all h1 to h6 elements across the entire website to turn white due to an incorrect CSS selector (footer h1, h2, h3,...). <br>
Resolution: The CSS selector was refined to explicitly target only headings within the footer by repeating the footer parent selector for each heading tag (e.g., footer h1, footer h2, ...). (Note: This fix is applied in your CSS sheet, but the comment in HTML flags it as a past bug.)
- **Typo in Hero Section Class:**<br>
Issue: The hero-section element had a typo in its Bootstrap class: caontainer-fluid.<br>
Resolution: Corrected the class name to container-fluid and rewrote styling for the hero-video.

## Credits

### Code Used
- Bootstrap 5.3.6: The primary front-end framework used for responsive design and UI components. Sourced from the official Bootstrap CDN.
- Google Fonts: Imported for custom typography, including Merriweather Sans (for headings) and Roboto Flex (for paragraphs).
- Font Awesome: Used for scalable vector icons across the site. Integrated via the Font Awesome CDN.
- CSS Box Shadow Inspiration: The specific box-shadow styles applied to various cards (#services-section .card, #benefits-section .card, .testimonials .card) were inspired by examples found on CSS Scan.

### Content

The textual content and overall narrative for this fictional website were a collaborative effort between the developer and AI.
To reflect realistic offerings in the corporate travel industry, various service and feature descriptions, as well as general website copy, were generated with the assistance of ChatGPT (by OpenAI) and Gemini (by Google). This process leveraged the developer's general knowledge of corporate travel and B2B sales combined with AI's ability to refine phrasing and generate authentic industry-aligned text.

### Media

Generative AI Imagery & Video: All custom images and the video were created by Gemini by Google.
