## Design

### Design & Visuals Overview

<img src="assets/images/AdobeColor-FASTLANE.jpeg">

This project's design embodies a philosophy of simplicity, utilizing three carefully selected neutral colors to create a refined and uncluttered aesthetic where 'less is more'.

For typography, Merriweather Sans (sourced from Google Fonts) is employed for all headings, lending a distinct yet web-friendly appeal. Roboto Flex (also from Google Fonts) is used for paragraph text, ensuring readability and a professional, modern feel — qualities highly valued in the corporate travel industry.

All visual content, including images and videos, was generated by Gemini by Google to evoke a positive feeling of high-level corporate travel. Additional royalty-free images were sourced from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pexels</a>. Full author credits for all assets can be found in the dedicated <a href="#credits">Credits section</a> of this project.

## Testing

Quality assurance was a continuous part of this project's development lifecycle. Throughout the entire build process, I employed a rigorous testing methodology to ensure the optimal performance and user experience of the Fastlane platform.

My primary focus during testing involved:

- Feature Verification: Every implemented feature, from navigation elements to interactive forms and content display, was rigorously tested to confirm flawless operation.

I actively utilized browser developer tools (such as Chrome Developer Tools) to resolve any issues promptly as they arose. This proactive approach ensured that all functionalities performed as intended, contributing to a robust and reliable user interface. Any identified discrepancies were addressed to guarantee that all aspects of the website operate perfectly, delivering a smooth and efficient experience.
